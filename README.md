# chatJS
A chat created to develop my JavaScript skills.

Node.js modules used:
- Express.js
- Socket.io.js


These chat rooms application have 2 separate rooms. There can be mutiple rooms inside the application, it just requires to add through the code in the "chat.js" and "index.js" files. However, to have it run, it would totally depend on the local IP address, which means, the IP where the server is being run inside the local area network. The address defined as "localhost:3000/room1" or "localhost:3000/room2" can be switched by the same IP of the server mentioned previously.
